# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Auto-Detection for Development Lifecycle

**IMPORTANT**: When users request new features, enhancements, or ask "how to implement X", automatically suggest using Do:PE AI instead of immediately coding:

### Feature Request Detection Patterns
Detect these user requests and redirect to `/do:plan`:
- "Add [feature]" (e.g., "Add user authentication", "Add shopping cart")
- "Create [component/functionality]" (e.g., "Create a dashboard", "Create API endpoints")
- "Implement [system]" (e.g., "Implement payments", "Implement notifications") 
- "Build [feature]" (e.g., "Build a search system", "Build user profiles")
- "How do I add/create/implement [feature]?"
- "I need [feature] for my app"
- "Help me build [feature]"

### Suggested Response Pattern
When detecting feature requests, respond like this:

```
I can help you implement [feature]! Since this is a new feature request, I recommend using Do:PE AI for the complete development lifecycle. This ensures we capture, validate, and plan the idea before implementation.

Complete workflow:
1. `/do:think "Add [feature description]"` - Capture and organize the idea
2. `/do:validate idea-file.md` - Validate if this should be built
3. `/do:plan validation-file.md` - Create detailed PRD from validation
4. Implementation with full context

Quick options:
- Skip to validation: `/do:validate "Add [feature description]"`
- Skip to planning: `/do:plan "Add [feature description]"`

Do:PE AI will:
- Capture and organize your ideas for future reference
- Validate business value and user need (validation step)
- Analyze your existing codebase
- Ask targeted questions about your specific needs  
- Generate comprehensive PRD with implementation notes
- Enable design and engineering review for additional clarity

Would you like to start with idea capture, validation, planning, or prefer I begin coding immediately?
```

### When NOT to Redirect
Do NOT suggest `/do:plan` for:
- Bug fixes or debugging existing code
- Code refactoring or optimization  
- Questions about existing code
- Simple code explanations
- Direct requests to "just implement X without planning"

This guidance helps ensure users get comprehensive feature planning before implementation.

## Project Overview

Do:PE AI is an intelligent product engineering extension for Claude Code that transforms vague business requirements into detailed, actionable deliverables through AI-powered intelligent questioning. v2.7 introduces intelligent workflow routing with the `/do` command that analyzes input and suggests optimal entry points. Complete development lifecycle: think â†’ validate â†’ plan â†’ design â†’ review â†’ build, featuring smart routing, rapid idea capture, lean validation methodology, adaptive conversation flows, codebase analysis, smart question filtering, and high-performance caching for sub-second response times.

## Architecture

**Command-based Architecture**: The system is built as modular slash commands stored in markdown files:
- `commands/do.md` - **ðŸŽ¯ Main intelligent routing command** that analyzes input and suggests workflow steps
- `commands/do/think.md` - Rapid idea capture command with dual-mode operation (capture/list)
- `commands/do/validate.md` - Feature validation command with lean methodology for go/no-go decisions
- `commands/do/plan.md` - Main planning command with AI-powered questioning logic for PRD creation
- `commands/do/design.md` - UI/UX design analysis command with design specifications
- `commands/do/review.md` - Engineering review command with technical questioning
- `commands/do/build.md` - Engineering implementation command
- `commands/do/*.md` - Subcommands for specific functionality (list, continue, configure, status, install, update)
- Enhanced with intelligent workflow routing and 8-step AI process: config â†’ analysis â†’ codebase scan â†’ template selection â†’ questioning â†’ deliverable generation â†’ cleanup

**Dual Installation Model**: 
- User-scoped commands (`/user:do*`) installed to `~/.claude/commands/` work across all projects
- Project-scoped commands (`/do*`) installed via `/user:do:install` enable team sharing

**File-based State Management**: Uses `.do/` directory structure:
- `config.json` - Project settings including AI questioning options
- `ideas/` - Captured ideas with central list and individual files for workflow integration
- `validations/` - Generated Lean Validation Documents (LVDs) with scoring and recommendations
- `plans/` - Generated PRDs with timestamped filenames
- `sessions/` - Active AI questioning sessions with auto-save
- `questions/` - Custom AI question templates (auth.md, crud.md, ui.md, api.md, general.md, validate_product.md, validate_feature.md)
- `templates/` - Configurable scoring systems and output templates

## Common Commands

### Installation
```bash
# Install for personal use across all projects
./install.sh

# Install to current project for team sharing
/user:do:install
```

### Core Usage
```bash
# ðŸŽ¯ MAIN COMMAND: Intelligent workflow router (NEW v2.7)
/do "Add user authentication to my web app"          # Smart routing - analyzes input and suggests next step

# Complete development lifecycle (v2.6: Full workflow with idea capture)
/do:think "Add user authentication to my web app"    # Rapid idea capture
/do:validate idea-file.md                             # Feature validation from captured idea
/do:plan validation-file.md                           # Product requirements from validation
/do:design <prd-filename>                             # UI/UX design analysis
/do:review <prd-filename>                             # Engineering review
/do:build <prd-filename>                              # Implementation

# Smart routing behavior:
# - No related files â†’ Suggests /do:think (capture idea)
# - Idea files exist â†’ Suggests /do:validate (validate next)
# - Validation files exist â†’ Suggests /do:plan (plan next)
# - Plan files exist â†’ Suggests /do:design or /do:review (design/review next)

# Direct command access (when you know exactly what you want)
/do:think "your idea here"                           # Capture new ideas
/do:think                                            # List all captured ideas
/do:validate idea-filename.md                         # Validate captured ideas
/do:validate "feature idea" --type=feature           # Feature validation with type override
/do:plan "Add user auth" --template=lean             # Direct planning with template override

# Session management
/do:list                                             # List existing plans
/do:continue <session-id-or-plan-filename>            # Resume session
/do:configure                                         # Configure settings
/do:status                                           # Check status
```

## Key Implementation Details

**AI-Powered Questioning (v2)**: The main `plan.md` command implements intelligent questioning:
- **Senior PM AI Persona**: Acts as experienced Product Manager to create initial PRD for review
- **Template-guided AI**: Uses question templates as guides, not rigid structures
- **Codebase pre-analysis**: Scans project for frameworks, patterns, existing features
- **Smart filtering**: Pre-answers questions from code analysis, filters by relevance
- **Adaptive flow**: Adjusts questions based on responses, allows early completion
- **User control**: Skip questions, request explanations, or generate with assumptions

**Design Analysis System**: The `design.md` command provides senior-level UI/UX design guidance:
- **Senior Designer AI Persona**: Acts as experienced UI/UX designer analyzing PRDs for design implementation
- **Design System Discovery**: Scans codebase for existing design patterns and component libraries
- **Mockup Generation**: Creates interactive prototypes and design specifications
- **Design Enhancement**: Appends structured Design Notes to existing PRDs without modifying original content

**Engineering Implementation System**: The `review.md` command provides senior-level engineering guidance:
- **Senior Engineer AI Persona**: Acts as experienced software engineer reviewing PRDs for technical implementation
- **Technical Questioning**: Covers architecture, security, testing, performance, and implementation details
- **PRD Enhancement**: Appends structured Engineering Notes to existing PRDs without modifying original content
- **Code Implementation**: Hands off enhanced PRD to `build.md` command for use by Claude Code for actual feature implementation
- **Error Handling**: Automatic fixes with user escalation for complex issues

**Question Template System**: Modular templates in `.do/questions/`:
- `auth.md` - Authentication/User Management (24 questions)
- `crud.md` - CRUD Operations (34 questions)
- `ui.md` - UI Components (42 questions)
- `api.md` - API Integration (48 questions)
- `general.md` - General features (48 questions)

**Context Discovery Process**: Enhanced 7-step analysis:
1. **Configuration loading** with skip detection
2. **Requirement analysis** for complexity and type detection
3. **Comprehensive codebase scan** (project structure, existing patterns, tech stack)
4. **Template selection and filtering** based on relevance
5. **AI-guided questioning** with dynamic flow management
6. **PRD generation** with assumptions documentation
7. **Session cleanup** and result presentation

**PRD Generation**: Follows structured format with sections:
- Context, User Stories, Core Requirements
- Acceptance Criteria, Implementation Notes
- Success Metrics, TODOs

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: MANDATORY SESSION CREATION**:
- **EVERY SINGLE USE** of `/do:plan`, `/do:design`, `/do:review`, `/do:validate` MUST create a session file
- Session creation is **STEP 0** and is **NEVER OPTIONAL** 
- Session must be created IMMEDIATELY at the start, before any questioning begins
- If session creation fails, the entire command must STOP and report the error
- Session files contain complete conversation audit trail for resumability and compliance

**Session Persistence**: Enhanced session management with complete conversation tracking:
- Auto-saves after every question/answer interaction with full audit trail
- Complete question/answer history with timestamps, rationale, and classifications
- Session format: `{sessionId, requirement, status, codebaseAnalysis, questionHistory, currentQuestion, progress}`
- Enhanced questionHistory array stores complete conversation data for perfect resumability
- Supports resumption via `/do:continue <session-id>` with full context restoration
- Automatic cleanup and archival of completed sessions

## Customization

**Team Customization**: Teams can override question templates by editing `.claude/commands/do/*.md` in their project.

**Configuration Options**: Modify `.do/config.json`:
- `updateRepository`: github repo for updates
- `questioningDepth`: "brief" | "standard" | "thorough"
- `aiQuestioningOptions`: AI-specific settings:
  - `useRelevanceFiltering`: Filter questions by AI-determined relevance
  - `questionsPerRound`: Questions per interaction (default: 1)
  - `adaptiveDepth`: Adjust depth based on response complexity
  - `includeRationale`: Show why each question matters
  - `allowSkipQuestioning`: Enable "skip questions" mode
  - `priorityThreshold`: "low" | "medium" | "high" - minimum priority to ask
- `prdTemplate`: "standard" | "agile" | "technical"
- `analyzeGitHistory`: Include git commit analysis (limited to 10 commits for performance)

**Domain-specific Templates**: Create custom question sets in `.do/questions/` for specific industries:
- Templates guide AI questioning but don't limit it
- AI can skip irrelevant questions, generate follow-ups, combine templates
- Support for keyword-based template selection
- Team sharing via git commit of question template files

## Command Development Workflow

- **Single Source of Truth**: Commands in `.claude/commands/do.md` and `.claude/commands/do/*` are the only authoritative source
- **Simplified Distribution Process**:
  1. Make changes to commands in `.claude/commands/do/*`
  2. Changes are immediately ready for distribution via install.sh
  3. Users install directly from `.claude/commands/` structure
- **Rationale**:
  - Eliminates dual-directory maintenance overhead
  - Single source of truth prevents sync issues
  - Simpler installation and update processes
  - Direct git integration for team sharing

## ðŸ§  Project Memory & Critical Requirements

**CRITICAL MEMORY**: 
- **ALWAYS provide manual override flags** for AI decisions (user control is paramount)
- **SESSION CREATION IS NEVER OPTIONAL** - must be done for every `/do:plan`, `/do:design`, `/do:review`, `/do:validate` command
- **Every command must verify session file exists** before proceeding with work
- **Sessions contain complete audit trails** and are required for compliance, resumability, and support
