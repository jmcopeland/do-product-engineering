# Product Validation Questions

These questions help validate an entire new product concept using lean startup methodology principles. They are designed to populate a Lean Validation Document (LVD) that assesses product-market fit before development.

## Problem Validation

### Problem Clarity (Priority: High)
1. **What specific problem does this product solve?** (Rationale: Clear problem definition is essential for product validation)
2. **Who exactly experiences this problem?** (Rationale: Defines target customer segments for validation)
3. **How often do your target users encounter this problem?** (Rationale: Frequency indicates problem severity and market size)
4. **What's the cost of not solving this problem for users?** (Rationale: Quantifies pain level and willingness to pay)
5. **How do people currently solve this problem?** (Rationale: Identifies competitive landscape and switching costs)

### Market Size (Priority: High)
6. **What's the size of your target market?** (Rationale: Determines business opportunity scale)
7. **How many potential customers exist in your primary market?** (Rationale: Quantifies addressable market size)
8. **What's the growth rate of this market?** (Rationale: Indicates future opportunity expansion)

## Solution Validation

### Value Proposition (Priority: High)
9. **What's your unique solution to this problem?** (Rationale: Defines core product offering)
10. **Why is your solution better than existing alternatives?** (Rationale: Identifies competitive advantage)
11. **What's your unfair advantage or defensible moat?** (Rationale: Assesses long-term competitive protection)
12. **What makes this solution hard to copy?** (Rationale: Evaluates sustainability of competitive position)

### Product-Market Fit Hypothesis (Priority: High)
13. **What's your core hypothesis about why customers will buy this?** (Rationale: Testable assumption for validation)
14. **What customer behavior change are you expecting?** (Rationale: Measures adoption difficulty)
15. **What would make customers switch from their current solution?** (Rationale: Identifies switching triggers and barriers)

## Customer Validation

### Target Segments (Priority: High)
16. **Who are your early adopters?** (Rationale: Identifies validation starting point)
17. **What characteristics define your ideal customer?** (Rationale: Enables targeted validation efforts)
18. **Which customer segment should you focus on first?** (Rationale: Prioritizes validation activities)

### Customer Development (Priority: Medium)
19. **How will you reach potential customers for validation?** (Rationale: Defines validation methodology)
20. **What channels will customers use to discover your product?** (Rationale: Informs go-to-market strategy)
21. **How will customers prefer to buy/access your product?** (Rationale: Shapes distribution model)

## Business Model Validation

### Revenue Model (Priority: High)
22. **How will you make money from this product?** (Rationale: Validates business sustainability)
23. **What pricing model makes sense for your customers?** (Rationale: Tests willingness to pay)
24. **What's your expected customer lifetime value?** (Rationale: Measures long-term business value)
25. **What are your customer acquisition costs likely to be?** (Rationale: Validates unit economics)

### Cost Structure (Priority: Medium)
26. **What are the major cost components for building this product?** (Rationale: Assesses resource requirements)
27. **What ongoing operational costs will you have?** (Rationale: Evaluates business model sustainability)
28. **At what scale does the business become profitable?** (Rationale: Determines viability milestones)

## Risk Assessment

### Market Risks (Priority: High)
29. **What if customers don't actually have this problem?** (Rationale: Tests core assumption)
30. **What if the market is too small?** (Rationale: Assesses market size risk)
31. **What if competitors solve this first?** (Rationale: Evaluates competitive risk)

### Execution Risks (Priority: Medium)
32. **What if you can't build the product as envisioned?** (Rationale: Assesses technical feasibility)
33. **What if customer acquisition is more expensive than expected?** (Rationale: Tests go-to-market assumptions)
34. **What if customers won't pay your expected price?** (Rationale: Validates pricing assumptions)

### Strategic Risks (Priority: Medium)
35. **What external factors could kill this product?** (Rationale: Identifies environmental threats)
36. **What would cause you to pivot or abandon this idea?** (Rationale: Sets clear kill criteria)

## Validation Plan

### Testing Strategy (Priority: High)
37. **How will you test your core hypothesis?** (Rationale: Defines validation methodology)
38. **What's the minimum you need to build to test your assumptions?** (Rationale: Determines MVP scope)
39. **How will you measure product-market fit?** (Rationale: Sets success criteria)
40. **What metrics will indicate strong validation?** (Rationale: Defines measurement framework)

### Timeline and Resources (Priority: Medium)
41. **How long should product validation take?** (Rationale: Sets validation timeline)
42. **What resources do you need for validation?** (Rationale: Assesses validation costs)
43. **Who should be involved in validation activities?** (Rationale: Defines validation team)

### Success Criteria (Priority: High)
44. **What results would convince you to build this product?** (Rationale: Sets go/no-go criteria)
45. **What customer feedback would validate your assumptions?** (Rationale: Defines qualitative success)
46. **What quantitative metrics would prove demand?** (Rationale: Defines quantitative success)
47. **At what point would you consider the product validated?** (Rationale: Sets validation completion criteria)
48. **What would make you confident to invest in full development?** (Rationale: Determines investment trigger)
