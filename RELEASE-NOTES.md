# AI Product Manager Release Notes

## v2.3.0 - Development Lifecycle Commands
**Release Date**: July 4, 2025  
**Focus**: Modular Development Lifecycle & Command Architecture

### 🔄 Development Lifecycle Restructure
Introducing a clear, modular command structure that maps to the complete development lifecycle!

#### New Command Architecture
- **`/pm:plan`** - Product requirements gathering (renamed from `pm:define`)
- **`/pm:review`** - Engineering review and technical analysis (split from `pm:implement`)  
- **`/pm:build`** - Feature implementation (split from `pm:implement`)

#### Future-Ready Structure
This release establishes the foundation for the complete development lifecycle:
```
plan → design → review → build → test → ship → learn
 📋     🎨      🔍      💻     🧪     🚀     📊
```

### ⚡ Enhanced Workflow
The new three-step process provides better separation of concerns:

```bash
# Step 1: Plan the feature
/pm:plan "Add user authentication"

# Step 2: Engineering review 
/pm:review user-auth-20250704.md

# Step 3: Build the feature
/pm:build user-auth-20250704.md
```

#### Benefits of the Split
- **Clearer responsibilities**: Product planning vs engineering review vs implementation
- **Better resumability**: Stop and resume at any stage of the development process
- **Modular approach**: Mix and match commands based on your workflow needs
- **Future extensibility**: Ready to add design, test, ship, and learn commands

### 🏗️ Backward Compatibility
- All existing PRDs continue to work seamlessly
- Configuration files automatically upgraded
- Documentation comprehensively updated
- Install scripts support new command structure

### 📊 Technical Improvements
- **Command modularity**: Each command has focused, single responsibility
- **Enhanced error handling**: Better guidance for missing files and invalid states
- **Improved documentation**: Updated examples and workflow guidance
- **Future-proof architecture**: Ready for upcoming lifecycle commands

```

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

### Community Feedback
Special thanks to early adopters who provided feedback on the template system limitations and requested more intelligent questioning.

### Design Principles
v2 was built on the principle that AI should **augment human judgment**, not replace it. The conversation control features ensure you remain in charge of the PRD creation process.

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Minor Limitations
- **Large Codebases**: Analysis limited to 30 seconds (graceful degradation)
- **Binary Files**: Analysis skips non-text files (expected behavior)
- **Git History**: Limited to 10 recent commits for performance

### Workarounds
- Use `/pm:configure` to disable git analysis for faster startup
- Set `contextDepth: "surface"` for very large projects
- Use skip mode for rapid iteration on familiar features

## 📞 Support

- **Documentation**: [docs/](docs/) directory
- **Issues**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/jmcopeland/ai-product-manager/issues)
- **Status Check**: `/pm:status` for system health
- **Configuration Help**: `/pm:configure` for interactive setup
