# PM Continue - Resume Existing Plan or Session

Resume work on an existing PRD plan or continue an interrupted AI questioning session.

## Task: Continue Plan Development

Target plan/session: "$ARGUMENTS"

### 1. Determine What to Continue

Check for both active sessions and existing plans:

**Active Sessions Check:**
1. Look for active sessions in `.do/sessions/`
2. Find sessions with `"status": "in-progress"`
3. If no arguments provided and active session exists, offer to resume it

**Existing Plans Check:**
1. Look for completed plans in `.do/plans/`
2. If specific filename provided, load that plan
3. If no arguments and no active sessions, list available plans

### 2. Resume Active AI Questioning Session

If continuing an interrupted AI questioning session:

1. **Load session state** from `.do/sessions/[session-id].json`:
   - Original requirement and analysis
   - Codebase analysis results
   - **Complete questionHistory** with all questions and answers
   - Current progress and context

2. **Verify session validity**:
   - Check if session is recent (< 24 hours old)
   - Validate session data integrity
   - Check if codebase has changed significantly

3. **Resume conversation with complete context**:
   ```
   🔄 Resuming your session for "[requirement]"
   
   📋 Progress Summary:
   Questions completed: [N] | Estimated total: [M]
   
   🗨️ Previous Q&A:
   Q1: [questionText] → [brief answer summary]
   Q2: [questionText] → [brief answer summary]
   ...
   
   ⏭️ Continuing where we left off...
   ```

4. **Continue AI questioning process with enhanced session tracking**:
   - **Pick up from currentQuestion** in session or generate next question based on questionHistory
   - **Use complete conversation context** from questionHistory for adaptive questioning
   - **Resume AI-powered questioning flow** with full conversation management:
     - Dynamic progress estimation based on previous Q&A patterns
     - User control signals (completion, dismissal, uncertainty)
     - Adaptive question generation informed by previous responses
     - **Enhanced session persistence** after each interaction with complete question/answer tracking
   - **Update session state** with full conversation history and metadata

### 3. Continue Existing Plan Development

If continuing work on a completed PRD:

1. **Load and analyze existing plan**:
   - Read plan content and current status
   - Check last modification date
   - Identify completeness level

2. **Determine continuation approach**:

   **If plan is incomplete (has TODOs, missing sections):**
   - Show what's missing or unclear
   - Restart AI questioning for gaps
   - Use existing plan content as context
   - Fill in missing sections

   **If plan is complete but user wants changes:**
   - Show current plan summary
   - Ask what aspects need modification
   - Use targeted questioning for specific areas
   - Update relevant sections with version notes

   **If plan is ready for implementation:**
   - Confirm plan is still current
   - Check if codebase has changed since plan creation
   - Ask if any changes needed before proceeding
   - Offer to begin implementation or make adjustments

3. **Update plan iteratively**:
   - Maintain original creation timestamp
   - Add "Last Updated" timestamp
   - Preserve implementation notes and progress
   - Add change notes in TODOs section

### 4. Handle Edge Cases

**Session not found:**
- If specified session doesn't exist, show available options
- Offer to start new session or continue existing plan

**Plan not found:**
- List available plans with brief descriptions
- Ask user to specify which plan to continue
- Offer to start new plan if needed

**Multiple active sessions:**
- Show list of active sessions with timestamps
- Ask user to choose which session to resume
- Provide context about each session

**Corrupted session/plan:**
- Show warning about corrupted data
- Offer to start fresh or attempt partial recovery
- Preserve original file as backup

### 5. Session and Plan Management

**Session cleanup and archival:**
- Mark resumed sessions as "completed" when PRD is generated
- Archive old session files automatically:
  - Sessions > 7 days old → move to `.do/sessions/archive/`
  - Completed sessions → move to archive after PRD generation
  - Failed/corrupted sessions → move to `.do/sessions/failed/`
- Clean up interrupted sessions that weren't resumed:
  - Sessions > 24 hours old with no recent activity
  - Warn user before cleanup, offer recovery option

**Session archival process:**
1. **Check session age and status** during continue operation
2. **Move old files** to appropriate subdirectories:
   ```
   .do/sessions/
   ├── active-session.json        # Current sessions
   ├── archive/                   # Completed/old sessions
   │   └── old-session.json
   └── failed/                    # Corrupted sessions
       └── corrupted-session.json
   ```
3. **Maintain session index** for quick lookup and statistics

**Plan versioning:**
- Track modification history in plan metadata:
  ```markdown
  **Last Updated:** [timestamp]
  **Modification Notes:** [what changed and why]
  **Previous Versions:** [links or notes about changes]
  ```
- Note what changed and why in TODOS section
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing plans

### 6. Interactive Flow Examples

**Resuming interrupted session:**
```
Found active session: "user-auth-20250701-080700"
Started 2 hours ago for "Add user authentication"

Progress so far:
✅ Requirement analysis (auth system, medium complexity)
✅ Codebase analysis (Express + React, no existing auth)
✅ 3 questions answered (auth methods, roles, session handling)

Continuing with question 4 of ~7...
```

**Continuing existing plan:**
```
Loading plan: "user-auth-20250630-143000.md"
Created yesterday, status: "Ready for Development"

This plan covers email/password + OAuth authentication.
What would you like to update or clarify?

Options:
1. Add new requirements
2. Modify existing requirements  
3. Update technical implementation
4. Review and proceed with implementation
```
