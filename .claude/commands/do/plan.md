# Do Plan - AI Product Manager

Act as a Senior AI Product Manager to transform vague requirements into detailed, actionable PRDs through intelligent, adaptive questioning.

## Task: AI-Powered Requirements Gathering

Given the user requirement: "$ARGUMENTS"

### üéõÔ∏è Argument Parsing, File Detection, and Template Override (Step 0)
**Parse command arguments, detect idea files, and handle template flag override:**

1. **Extract template flag first (preserve flags before file resolution)**:
   - Parse original `$ARGUMENTS` to extract any `--template=<template_name>` flag
   - Store template flag separately to preserve it through file resolution
   - Remove template flag from arguments for cleaner file detection

2. **File Detection and Content Resolution**:
   - Check if remaining arguments appear to be a file reference (ends with .md or is a valid file path)
   - If file reference detected, resolve using smart path logic:
     - If absolute path (/...) or relative path (./...): use directly
     - Otherwise: check `.do/ideas/$ARGUMENTS` first, then `$ARGUMENTS` in current directory
   - If file found: read content and use as the requirement text
   - If file not found: show helpful error with available alternatives
   - Combine file content (or original text) with preserved template flag

3. **Extract requirement from resolved content**:
   - Parse final `$ARGUMENTS` to separate quoted requirement from any flags
   - If no quotes found, treat entire string as requirement (backward compatibility)
   
2. **Template validation and override**:
   ```
   If template flag found:
   ‚Ä¢ Validate template exists in .do/templates/ directory
   ‚Ä¢ If invalid template: show error with available options, let user choose
   ‚Ä¢ If valid template: override config.prdTemplate for this session
   ‚Ä¢ Show feedback: "üöÄ Analyzing: "[requirement]" (using [template] template)"
   
   If no template flag:
   ‚Ä¢ Use config.prdTemplate default (backward compatibility)
   ‚Ä¢ No additional feedback shown
   ```

3. **Argument parsing implementation**:
   ```bash
   # Step 1: Extract and preserve template flag from original arguments
   TEMPLATE_FLAG=""
   if [[ "$ARGUMENTS" =~ --template=([a-zA-Z0-9-]+) ]]; then
     TEMPLATE_FLAG="--template=${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
     # Remove template flag for cleaner file detection
     CLEAN_ARGS="${ARGUMENTS//$TEMPLATE_FLAG/}"
     CLEAN_ARGS="${CLEAN_ARGS%% }" # Trim trailing space
   else
     CLEAN_ARGS="$ARGUMENTS"
   fi
   
   # Step 2: Detect and resolve file reference
   if [[ "$CLEAN_ARGS" == *.md ]] || [[ -f "$CLEAN_ARGS" ]]; then
     # File detection logic here...
     FILE_CONTENT=$(cat "$FILE_PATH")
     # Reconstruct arguments with file content + preserved template flag
     if [[ -n "$TEMPLATE_FLAG" ]]; then
       ARGUMENTS="\"$FILE_CONTENT\" $TEMPLATE_FLAG"
     else
       ARGUMENTS="\"$FILE_CONTENT\""
     fi
   fi
   
   # Step 3: Continue with normal parsing of reconstructed arguments
   ```
   - Extract quoted requirement: match pattern `"([^"]+)"`  
   - Extract template flag: match pattern `--template=([a-zA-Z0-9-]+)`
   - Handle edge cases: missing quotes, malformed flags, multiple flags
   - Graceful degradation with helpful error messages

4. **Template override logic**:
   - Load config.json to get availableTemplates list
   - Validate specified template exists in list
   - Override prdTemplate value for this session only
   - Track template selection in session metadata

**BEFORE STARTING: Use TodoWrite to create a plan with all mandatory steps**

Use the TodoWrite tool to create todos for each mandatory step:
1. "üö® CRITICAL: Parse arguments and create session file (NEVER SKIP)"
2. "Load configuration, apply template override, and check for skip signals"  
3. "Analyze requirement and complexity"
4. "Perform comprehensive codebase analysis"
5. "Load and filter question templates"
6. "Conduct AI-guided interactive questioning"
7. "Generate PRD with collected information"
8. "Save results and verify session exists"

Mark each step as "in_progress" when starting and "completed" when finished.

**üö® IMPORTANT: ALL 7 STEPS BELOW ARE MANDATORY - NONE CAN BE SKIPPED**

### üö® CRITICAL: Argument Parsing and Session Creation (MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP) üö®
**‚ö†Ô∏è STOP! READ THIS FIRST! ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**ARGUMENT PARSING AND SESSION CREATION ARE ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY. NO EXCEPTIONS. EVER.**

**YOU MUST PARSE ARGUMENTS AND CREATE A SESSION FILE BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE.**

1. **Parse command arguments first**:
   - **Extract template flag FIRST**: Parse original `$ARGUMENTS` for `--template=<template_name>`
   - **Store template flag**: Keep template flag separate from file/requirement detection
   - **File Detection**: Check if remaining arguments appear to be a file reference
   - **Smart File Resolution**: Use `.do/ideas/` priority with fallback to direct paths
   - **Content Loading**: If file found, read content as requirement text
   - **Combine components**: Reconstruct `$ARGUMENTS` with file content + preserved template flag
   - **Error Handling**: If file not found, show helpful error with alternatives
   - Extract requirement from final `$ARGUMENTS` (look for quoted text)
   - Handle backward compatibility for non-quoted requirements
   - Prepare template override for Step 1

2. **Create session directory if needed**: Ensure `.do/sessions/` exists
3. **Generate session ID**: `plan-[requirement-slug]-[YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS]`
4. **Create initial session file** immediately with status "initializing" and template metadata
5. **If parsing or session creation fails**: STOP and report error to user
6. **VERIFY**: Session file exists and arguments parsed before proceeding to Step 1

**IF YOU SKIP ARGUMENT PARSING OR SESSION CREATION, YOU ARE VIOLATING A CRITICAL REQUIREMENT.**

### Step 1: Load Configuration and Apply Template Override (MANDATORY)
Load configuration and apply template override from parsed arguments:

1. **Load config** from `.do/config.json`
   - If config missing, use sensible defaults
   - Check if `allowSkipQuestioning` is enabled
   - Note original `prdTemplate` value for reference

2. **Apply template override** (if template flag was found):
   - Validate template exists in `availableTemplates` list from config
   - If invalid template: show error with available options, let user choose or proceed with default
   - If valid template: override `prdTemplate` for this session
   - Show feedback only when overriding: "üöÄ Analyzing: '[requirement]' (using [template] template)"
   - Update session file with template selection

3. **Template validation error handling**:
   ```
   ‚ùå Template '[template]' not found.
   
   Available templates:
   ‚Ä¢ standard (default)
   ‚Ä¢ agile
   ‚Ä¢ lean
   ‚Ä¢ technical
   ‚Ä¢ design-first
   ‚Ä¢ one-pager
   ‚Ä¢ bdd
   
   Choose an option:
   1. Select a valid template from the list above
   2. Proceed with default template (standard)
   3. Restart with correct template flag
   
   What would you like to do?
   ```

4. **Check for skip signals** in the requirement:
   - Direct skip: "skip questions", "no questions", "just generate", "use defaults", and other similar signals
   - Contextual skip: "make assumptions", "best practices", "don't ask me", and other similar signals
   - If skip detected and allowed, jump to Step 6 (Generate with Assumptions)
   - If skip detected but not allowed, inform user and proceed normally

5. **Handle skip request**:
   ```
   I understand you'd like me to skip questioning and make assumptions.
   I'll analyze your codebase thoroughly and use industry best practices
   to generate a comprehensive PRD.
   
   Proceeding with assumption-based generation...
   ```

### Step 2: Analyze Requirement and Complexity (MANDATORY)
Analyze the user requirement to understand what we're building:

1. **Extract key concepts** and technical terms
2. **Identify requirement type(s)** (can be multiple):
   - Authentication/User Management ‚Üí auth template (keywords: login, signup, user, profile, permission, role)
   - CRUD operations ‚Üí crud template (keywords: create, read, update, delete, manage, edit, list)
   - UI/Components ‚Üí ui template (keywords: component, interface, design, layout, form, button)
   - API/Integration ‚Üí api template (keywords: API, endpoint, service, integration, webhook, external)
   - General/Other ‚Üí general template (fallback for unclear requirements)
3. **Assess complexity** based on keywords and scope:
   - Simple: "add button", "change color", "basic", single action
   - Medium: "authentication", "CRUD", "form", "profile", standard feature
   - Complex: "real-time", "collaborative", "integration", "migration", multi-system feature
4. **Determine if breakdown needed**:
   - If complex, offer to break into smaller PRDs
   - If user accepts breakdown, focus on one component

### Step 3: Comprehensive Codebase Analysis (MANDATORY)
Perform deep codebase analysis to pre-answer questions:

1. **Project structure analysis** (fast scan):
   - Find package.json, requirements.txt, composer.json, Cargo.toml, etc.
   - Identify framework (React, Vue, Express, Django, Laravel, etc.)
   - Locate main directories (src/, app/, components/, models/, etc.)
   - Scan only top 3 levels initially for performance

2. **Find similar existing features** (targeted search):
   - Use Grep tool to search for requirement-related patterns
   - Look for auth patterns: "login", "signup", "authenticate", "user"
   - Look for CRUD patterns: "create", "update", "delete", "findBy"
   - Look for UI patterns: "component", "form", "modal", "page"
   - Limit search to common file extensions (.js, .ts, .py, .php, .rb)

3. **Extract technical context** (essential only):
   - Database: Check for migrations, schema files, model definitions
   - Auth: Look for auth middleware, user models, session handling
   - UI: Identify component library (Material-UI, Bootstrap, Tailwind)
   - API: Find route definitions, controller patterns
   - Stop analysis after 30 seconds to avoid blocking

4. **Analyze git history** (if configured and fast):
   - Only scan last 10 commits for performance
   - Look for commits related to similar features (auth, user, profile, CRUD)
   - Extract development patterns and naming conventions
   - Skip if git log takes >10 seconds

### Step 4: Load and Filter Question Templates (MANDATORY)
Intelligently select and filter questions:

1. **Load relevant templates** from `.do/questions/`:
   - Based on requirement type analysis from Step 2
   - May load multiple templates if requirement spans categories

2. **Pre-answer questions from codebase**:
   - Mark questions as "answered" if codebase analysis provides clear answers
   - Note the source of pre-answered information (e.g., "Found React in package.json")
   - Skip redundant questions (e.g., don't ask about auth library if already using one)

3. **Filter by relevance and priority**:
   - Apply `priorityThreshold` from config (low/medium/high)
   - Remove questions not relevant to this specific requirement
   - Prioritize questions that can't be answered from codebase
   - Use keyword matching and intent analysis to filter relevant questions only
   - For "user profile" requirement: focus on auth + CRUD questions, skip API integration

4. **Create question queue**:
   - Order questions by importance and logical flow
   - Prepare rationale for each question
   - Set initial progress estimate (dynamic)

### Step 5: AI-Guided Interactive Questioning (MANDATORY)
Conduct intelligent, conversational questioning with dynamic flow management:

1. **Initialize session and present context**:
   ```
   üöÄ Analyzing: "[requirement]"
   
   I've analyzed your codebase and found:
   ‚Ä¢ [Framework/tech stack discovered]
   ‚Ä¢ [Existing related features, if any]
   ‚Ä¢ [Key patterns that inform this feature]
   
   I'll ask focused questions one at a time to create a detailed PRD.
   
   üéØ Control the conversation:
   ‚Ä¢ Answer normally to proceed
   ‚Ä¢ Say "good to go" when you have enough
   ‚Ä¢ Say "skip" or "not relevant" to dismiss questions
   ‚Ä¢ Say "skip questions" to generate with assumptions only
   
   Ready to start? (üìù Estimated: ~6-10 questions)
   ```

2. **Create session file** with unique ID: `[requirement-slug]-[YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS].json`
   - If session file already exists, update the status to 'in-progress'.
   ```json
   {
     "sessionId": "[requirement-slug]-[YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS]",
     "requirement": "[original user requirement]",
     "templateOverride": "[template name if flag was used]",
     "templateSource": "flag|config",
     "status": "in-progress",
     "createdAt": "[ISO timestamp]",
     "lastUpdated": "[ISO timestamp]",
     "codebaseAnalysis": {
       "framework": "[detected framework]",
       "existingPatterns": ["pattern1", "pattern2"],
       "techStack": ["tech1", "tech2"]
     },
     "templateSelection": ["auth", "crud"],
     "questionHistory": [],
     "currentQuestion": {
       "questionId": "auth-1",
       "questionText": "How should users sign up?",
       "rationale": "Determines signup flow complexity",
       "category": "auth",
       "priority": "high",
       "timestamp": "[ISO timestamp when asked]"
     },
     "progress": {
       "questionsAsked": 0,
       "estimatedTotal": "6-10",
       "topicsCompleted": [],
       "currentTopic": "requirements"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Dynamic question presentation loop**:
   For each question until completion or user stops:
   
   **a) Present question with context**:
   ```
   ‚ùì Question [current] ‚Ä¢ [topic area] ‚Ä¢ [progress indicator]
   
   [The actual question]
   
   üß† Context: [rationale - why this matters for the PRD]
   ```
   
   **Example:**
   ```
   ‚ùì Question 2 ‚Ä¢ User Authentication ‚Ä¢ Covered: requirements ‚úì | Exploring: auth, data
   
   How should users sign up for accounts? (email/username, social login, etc.)
   
   üß† Context: This determines the signup flow complexity and which auth libraries we'll need. Helps define the user onboarding section of the PRD.
   ```
   
   **b) Wait for user response and classify it**:
   
   **Direct Answers** ‚Üí Process and continue:
   - Save answer to session
   - Generate next logical question based on this response
   - Update progress estimate
   
   **Completion Signals** ‚Üí End questioning:
   - Detect: "good to go", "looks good", "sounds good", "continue", "proceed", "that's enough", etc.
   - Confirm: "‚úÖ Perfect! I have enough information to create a comprehensive PRD."
   - Move to Step 6 (Generate PRD)
   
   **Dismissal Signals** ‚Üí Skip and continue:
   - Detect: "not relevant", "skip", "doesn't matter", "not important", "move on", etc.
   - Acknowledge: "üëç Understood, skipping that aspect."
   - Mark question as dismissed in session
   - Move to next question
   
   **Uncertainty Signals** ‚Üí Offer options:
   - Detect: "I don't know", "not sure", "maybe", "unclear", "help me decide", etc.
   - Present friendly options:
     ```
     ü§î No worries! Let's handle this:
     
     1. üìö Explore this now (I'll explain the tradeoffs)
     2. üìù Defer as a TODO for later consideration  
     3. ‚ú® Use a sensible default based on best practices
     4. ‚è≠Ô∏è Skip this aspect entirely
     
     What works for you?
     ```
   - Handle choice and update session accordingly
   
   **Clarification Requests** ‚Üí Provide explanation:
   - Detect: "why are you asking", "why does this matter", "explain", "what's the point", etc.
   - Provide deeper rationale:
     ```
     üí° Great question! Here's why this matters:
     
     **Business impact:** [How this affects users/business]
     **Technical impact:** [How this affects implementation]
     **PRD impact:** [What section this helps define]
     
     [Re-ask the original question]
     ```
   
   **c) Update session after each interaction**:
   - **Save complete question/answer pair to questionHistory**:
     ```json
     {
       "questionId": "unique-id",
       "questionText": "Complete question as presented to user",
       "rationale": "Why this question matters for the PRD",
       "category": "auth|crud|ui|api|general",
       "priority": "high|medium|low",
       "timestamp": "ISO-timestamp-when-asked",
       "userResponse": "Complete user response exactly as provided",
       "responseClassification": "direct_answer|skip|completion|uncertainty|clarification",
       "responseTimestamp": "ISO-timestamp-when-answered"
     }
     ```
   - **Update currentQuestion** with next question if continuing
   - **Update progress tracking** and session metadata
   - **Persist complete session state** to disk with full conversation history

4. **Adaptive question flow management**:
   
   **Dynamic Progress Estimation**:
   - Start with initial estimate from template filtering (e.g., "~6-10 questions")
   - Adjust based on response complexity and follow-ups generated
   - Show progress as "Question 3, exploring auth methods..." instead of "3 of 8"
   - Provide topic-based progress: "Covered: requirements, auth ‚úì | Exploring: data model, UI"
   
   **Follow-up Question Generation**:
   - If answer reveals complexity, generate specific follow-ups
   - If answer is vague, ask for clarification
   - If answer contradicts codebase findings, explore the difference
   
   **Redundancy Detection**:
   - Skip questions already answered implicitly by previous responses
   - Cross-reference with codebase pre-answered questions
   - Combine related questions for efficiency
   
   **Depth Adaptation**:
   - For complex responses: dive deeper with follow-ups
   - For simple responses: move to next topic quickly
   - For expert-level responses: skip basic questions in that area

5. **Session persistence and cleanup**:
   - **Auto-save session after every user response** with complete question/answer data
   - **Maintain full conversation audit trail** in questionHistory array
   - **Include all metadata:** timestamps, classifications, rationale, categories
   - **Handle interruptions gracefully** - session can be fully resumed via `/do:continue`
   - **Archive session file** when PRD is successfully generated (move to archive, don't delete)

### Step 6: Generate PRD with Collected Information (MANDATORY)
Create comprehensive PRD using all gathered information:

1. **Synthesize all inputs**:
   - User requirement and responses
   - Codebase analysis findings
   - Pre-answered template questions
   - User-provided answers

2. **Generate PRD sections**: (should be based on the selected template - either from --template flag override or config.json `prdTemplate`. Sections below are for the `standard.md` template)
   - **Context**: Feature background with codebase integration notes
   - **User Stories**: Based on requirement and user responses
   - **Core Requirements**: Detailed functional requirements by category
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable criteria
   - **Implementation Notes**: 
     - Files likely to change (from codebase analysis)
     - Technical considerations (integration with existing patterns)
     - Dependencies and constraints
   - **Success Metrics**: How to measure success
   - **TODOs**: Unresolved questions or deferred decisions

3. **Include assumptions section** (if questions were skipped or minimal questioning):
   - **If full skip**: List comprehensive assumptions made from codebase analysis and best practices
   - **If partial skip**: Note dismissed questions and assumed answers
   - **If early termination**: Document what wasn't explored
   - Note areas that may need clarification
   - Suggest follow-up questions for future refinement
   
   **Assumptions format**:
   ```markdown
   ## Assumptions Made
   
   **From Codebase Analysis:**
   - [Technology stack assumptions based on files found]
   - [Integration patterns assumed from existing code]
   - [Security assumptions from current implementation]
   
   **From Industry Best Practices:**
   - [Standard approaches for this type of feature]
   - [Common implementation patterns]
   - [Typical user experience flows]
   
   **Areas for Future Clarification:**
   - [Specific questions that could refine requirements]
   - [Business decisions that may affect implementation]
   - [User experience details that need validation]
   ```

### Step 7: Save and Present Results (MANDATORY - CRITICAL - VERIFY ALL STEPS)
Finalize the PRD and present to user:

1. **Generate PRD content** based on all collected information and the selected template (either from --template flag override or config.json `prdTemplate`)
2. **Create PRD file** with timestamped filename: `do-[feature-name]-[YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS].md`
   - MUST create file in `.do/plans/` directory
   - MUST write complete PRD content to file
   - MUST verify file was created successfully
   - If file creation fails: STOP and report error
3. **Verify PRD exists**:
   - Read back the file to confirm it was written
   - Check file size is reasonable (not empty)
   - If verification fails: STOP and report error
4. **Update session** with PRD filename and completion status
5. **Archive session** to `.do/sessions/archive/`
   - DO NOT delete original session file
   - Copy to archive with completion timestamp
6. **Only after verification**, present summary:
   ```
   üéâ PRD Successfully Created!
   
   üìÑ **File:** [filename]
   üìä **Complexity:** [1-5] | **Questions Asked:** [N]
   
   üéØ **Key Decisions Made:**
   ‚Ä¢ [Summary of main decisions]
   
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Areas Flagged for Attention:**
   ‚Ä¢ [Any TODOs or assumptions]
   
   üöÄ **Ready for implementation?** 
   Say "proceed" to begin development or "/do:list" to see all plans.
   ```

## Configuration-Driven Behavior

The process adapts based on `.do/config.json` settings:

- **useRelevanceFiltering**: Filter questions by AI-determined relevance
- **priorityThreshold**: "low"/"medium"/"high" - minimum priority to ask
- **includeRationale**: Show reasoning for each question
- **allowSkipQuestioning**: Enable skip option
- **adaptiveDepth**: Adjust questioning based on response complexity
- **Template Selection**: Use the selected template (from --template flag or config.json `prdTemplate`) to find the output template in the `.do/templates` directory. Adjust questioning to answer the necessary information to fill out the template. Output the file in the format specified by the template file.

## Error Handling and Fallbacks

### Configuration and Setup Errors
- **Missing config file**: Create default config and continue
  ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Config not found. Created default .do/config.json with AI-powered questioning.
  ```
- **Invalid config values**: Use sensible defaults, warn user
  ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Invalid config value for 'priorityThreshold'. Using 'medium' as default.
  ```
- **Missing question templates**: Download/recreate from defaults, or use general.md
  ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Question templates missing. Using built-in general questions.
  ```
- **Permission errors**: Inform user about directory access needs
  ```
  ‚ùå Cannot create .do directory. Check write permissions in this project.
  ```

### Session Management Errors
- **Session file corruption**: Backup corrupted file, start fresh session
  ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Session file corrupted. Backed up to [filename].backup. Starting fresh session.
  ```
- **Concurrent sessions**: Warn about multiple active sessions, let user choose
  ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Found 2 active sessions. Continue existing session or start new?
  1. Continue: "user-auth-20250701-140000" (2 questions asked)
  2. Start new session
  ```
- **Session directory issues**: Create missing directories, fix permissions
  ```
  ‚úÖ Created missing .do/sessions directory.
  ```
- **Disk space issues**: Clean up old archives, warn user
  ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Sessions directory large (50+ files). Run /do:status for cleanup suggestions.
  ```

### Codebase Analysis Errors
- **Large codebase timeout**: Limit analysis scope, continue with partial results
- **Binary files errors**: Skip non-text files, continue analysis
- **Git history errors**: Skip git analysis, continue with file structure only
- **Access permission errors**: Skip restricted files, continue with accessible ones

### Conversation Flow Errors
- **User input parsing errors**: Ask for clarification, provide examples
- **Interrupted conversations**: Auto-save state, enable clean resumption
- **Template loading failures**: Fall back to general questions, warn user
- **Response classification failures**: Treat as direct answer, continue

### PRD Generation Errors (CRITICAL FAILURES)
- **File creation errors**: 
  ```
  ‚ùå CRITICAL ERROR: Failed to create PRD file
  
  Error: [specific error message]
  Directory: .do/plans/
  Attempted filename: [filename]
  
  This is a critical failure. Please check:
  ‚Ä¢ Directory permissions
  ‚Ä¢ Disk space availability
  ‚Ä¢ File system issues
  
  Cannot proceed without successful PRD creation.
  ```
- **File verification errors**:
  ```
  ‚ùå CRITICAL ERROR: PRD file creation appears to have failed
  
  File was not found after creation attempt: [filename]
  
  This indicates a serious file system issue.
  Session has been preserved for recovery.
  ```
- **Content generation errors**: Use basic template, include raw Q&A data
- **Timestamp errors**: Use fallback timestamp format
- **Permission errors**: Report exact permissions needed

### Recovery Strategies
- **Graceful degradation**: Always try to provide some value even with errors
- **User notification**: Clear error messages with suggested actions
- **Automatic recovery**: Retry failed operations where safe
- **Fallback modes**: Template mode if AI features fail

### File Detection Implementation Details
Complete implementation for preserving template flags during file resolution:

```bash
# Step 1: Extract and preserve template flag
TEMPLATE_FLAG=""
if [[ "$ARGUMENTS" =~ --template=([a-zA-Z0-9-]+) ]]; then
  TEMPLATE_FLAG="--template=${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
  # Remove template flag for cleaner file detection
  CLEAN_ARGS="${ARGUMENTS//$TEMPLATE_FLAG/}"
  CLEAN_ARGS="${CLEAN_ARGS%% }" # Trim trailing space
else
  CLEAN_ARGS="$ARGUMENTS"
fi

# Step 2: Detect and resolve file reference
if [[ "$CLEAN_ARGS" == *.md ]] || [[ -f "$CLEAN_ARGS" ]]; then
  # Likely a file reference
  if [[ "$CLEAN_ARGS" == /* ]] || [[ "$CLEAN_ARGS" == ./* ]]; then
    # Absolute or relative path - use directly
    FILE_PATH="$CLEAN_ARGS"
  else
    # Simple filename - check .do/ideas/ first
    if [[ -f ".do/ideas/$CLEAN_ARGS" ]]; then
      FILE_PATH=".do/ideas/$CLEAN_ARGS"
    elif [[ -f "$CLEAN_ARGS" ]]; then
      FILE_PATH="$CLEAN_ARGS"
    else
      # File not found - show error
      echo "‚ùå Idea file not found: $CLEAN_ARGS"
      echo ""
      echo "Searched locations:"
      echo "‚Ä¢ .do/ideas/$CLEAN_ARGS"
      echo "‚Ä¢ ./$CLEAN_ARGS"
      echo ""
      echo "üí° Options:"
      echo "‚Ä¢ Check available ideas: /do:think"
      echo "‚Ä¢ Use full path: /do:plan /path/to/file.md"
      echo "‚Ä¢ Input directly: /do:plan \"your requirement here\""
      exit 1
    fi
  fi
  
  # Read file content
  FILE_CONTENT=$(cat "$FILE_PATH" 2>/dev/null)
  if [[ -z "$FILE_CONTENT" ]]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è File is empty or unreadable: $FILE_PATH"
    echo ""
    echo "Would you like to input the requirement manually instead?"

**BEFORE STARTING: Use TodoWrite to create a plan with all mandatory steps**

Use the TodoWrite tool to create todos for each mandatory step:
1. "Parse arguments and create session file"
2. "Load configuration and apply template override"  
3. "Analyze requirement and complexity"
4. "Perform comprehensive codebase analysis"
5. "Load and filter question templates"
6. "Conduct AI-guided interactive questioning"
7. "Generate PRD with collected information"
8. "Save results and verify session exists"

Mark each step as "in_progress" when starting and "completed" when finished.

**Begin the AI-powered requirements gathering process now with**: "$ARGUMENTS"
